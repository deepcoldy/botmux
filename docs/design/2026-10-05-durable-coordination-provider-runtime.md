# Durable coordination provider runtime

## Goal

BotMux needs to consume a durable coordination implementation without linking a database client or deployment-specific credentials into the public binary. The runtime therefore starts one operator-selected JSONL provider process and exposes it through the existing `DurableCoordinationStore` interface.

The process is a trusted runtime extension, not a plugin for model code. BotMux launches it directly without a shell, never copies provider stderr into protocol errors, and validates every response before it reaches daemon state.

## Protocol

Every line is one JSON request or response with:

- protocol `botmux.durable-coordination-provider`;
- wire version `1`;
- a stable `requestId`;
- an initial `hello` that proves durable contract version `1`;
- a `call` for one public store method.

The provider may respond out of order. BotMux correlates by `requestId`, bounds line size and request time, rejects unknown request ids, and terminates the provider after a timeout or malformed response. Provider failures carry a bounded public code, a redacted message, and explicit retryability; retryability never changes outbox ambiguity rules.

## Configuration

The default remains disabled. The public runtime reads only provider-neutral settings:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `BOTMUX_COORDINATION_MODE` | `disabled`, `shadow`, or `primary` |
| `BOTMUX_COORDINATION_PROVIDER_BIN` | Absolute executable path; required outside `disabled` |
| `BOTMUX_COORDINATION_PROVIDER_ARGS_JSON` | Optional JSON string array; no shell parsing |
| `BOTMUX_COORDINATION_PROVIDER_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_MS` | Optional bounded hello timeout |
| `BOTMUX_COORDINATION_PROVIDER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | Optional bounded call timeout |

The provider inherits the daemon environment because it is selected by the operator and may need file-based credential references. Provider code must keep secrets out of stdout, stderr, argv, receipts, and durable JSON values.

## Rollout boundary

`shadow` currently starts the provider, verifies the exact public contract, and keeps the process alive through daemon shutdown. It does not replace the SQLite Session path and does not mirror live data implicitly.

`primary` fails closed until all three runtime stages are present:

1. ACK-safe durable inbox ingestion and claim loop;
2. an asynchronous fenced Session facade;
3. a durable outbox pump with explicit attempt/receipt reconciliation.

This prevents a deployment from enabling multiple independent SQLite writers by setting one premature flag. A later change must remove the `primary` gate only together with the complete data path and its failure tests.

## Shutdown

Graceful daemon shutdown requests provider `close` and bounds the response. Fatal process exit terminates the child synchronously. A provider close failure is logged without provider stderr, the child is terminated, and the daemon continues its existing bounded shutdown.

## Verification

Tests cover handshake compatibility, round-trip calls, redacted retryable errors, malformed results, timeouts, disabled defaults, primary fail-closed behavior, and shadow lifecycle cleanup. The existing durable contract suite continues to cover state-machine semantics independently of transport.

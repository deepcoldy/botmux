/**
 * Decision logic for "should the worker suppress its transcript-driven
 * fallback emit for this Lark turn?"
 *
 * Pure function with no I/O — kept separate from worker.ts so the rules
 * (including the type-ahead window and the adopt-vs-non-adopt branching)
 * can be tested deterministically. The worker reads marker entries from
 * disk and threads them through here.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - Adopt mode never suppresses: in /adopt the model in the adopted
 *     session is unaware of botmux, so transcript drain is the ONLY
 *     channel from model to Lark. There's no `botmux send` to compete
 *     with, hence no marker to gate on.
 *   - Non-adopt + isLocal: suppress. A local-typing turn means the
 *     attribution queue saw a user event whose content didn't match any
 *     pending Lark fingerprint. In a worker-spawned CLI that's a Web
 *     terminal hand-typed input — the user is already looking at it, no
 *     reason to push it back to the Lark thread.
 *   - Non-adopt + send observed in window: suppress. The window is
 *     [turn.markTimeMs, nextBoundaryMs); any `botmux send` whose
 *     sentAtMs falls inside means the model already delivered this turn
 *     to Lark itself. Boundary handling intentionally also considers
 *     queue items that haven't reached "ready" yet (passed in via
 *     nextBoundaryMs) — without that, a model that's still mid-tool-use
 *     for turn N+1 could leak a send credit into turn N's window.
